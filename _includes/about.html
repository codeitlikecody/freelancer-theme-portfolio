        <p>My journey as a computer science graduate has just begun and I am excited to see where my adventure takes me next. 
          With specialisations in software development and data science, you could say I have a knack for making sense of 
          numbers and a passion for crafting powerful backend solutions. </p>
      
        <p>But hey, my story doesn't start and end with lines of code on a screen. Before I pursued a career in the digital realm, 
          I was busy behind the scenes in the arts and entertainment industry, tweaking lights, perfecting sound, and making sure 
          the show always goes on. My tech journey is coloured with a vibrant mix of creativity and logic.</p>

        <p><strong>üêç Python Aficionado</strong> </p>
        <p>Python isn't just a programming language for me; it's a canvas where I paint my 
          digital masterpieces. I speak Python fluently and use it to craft elegant solutions and wrangle data into meaningful insights.

        <p>While others might focus on the glitz and glamour of the front end, I find my magic
           in the backend. I love architecting robust systems and creating the backbone that makes applications tick seamlessly.</p>
