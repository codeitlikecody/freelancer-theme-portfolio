description: Performed statistical analysis on scientific data to predict the effect of Creatine Kinase levels on heart attack risk. Fit a generalised linear model on provided data using R. Assessed the model quality and determined it was a good fit with CK being a good predictor of heart attack. Used the model to predict that 75% of patients would likely suffer a heart attack with CK levels of 126.14 IU/L or above. Visualised the model in R studio, highlighting the 75th percentile in line with our predictions
