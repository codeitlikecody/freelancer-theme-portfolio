description: In early 2023 I designed a communication protocol for performing basic database operations across a network. As part of this project, I created console based server and client applications in Python that can communicate via TLS/SSL, allowing teh client to perform database CRUD operations remotely. The project includes industry standard security features like user authentication, encryption and restricting the number of connections per client.
