description: In late 2023 I created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI that consolidates data from several databases, performs conditional joins, lookups and filtering across these datasets before generating beautiful and informative visualisations that direct decision making. The dashboard allows my team to view and analyse resource demands across the School of Music and Performance at Monash University, including music practice rooms, event spaces and equipment hire. The dashboard has identified teaching schedule changes that could increase teaching capacity by up to 30% and is guiding the construction of additional rehearsal spaces by highlighting the demand for specific room configurations. As I continue to develop the dashboard, I am looking to incorporate machine learning to predict future resource demands and to identify further opportunities for efficiency gains.
