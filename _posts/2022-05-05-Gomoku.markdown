description: In 2022 I created Gomoku, a full stack  web app of the popular game, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS). Using Typescript, I implimented a custom REST API. The site is hosted inside a docker container on Netlify. With continuous deployment for fast and frequent updates, the game can be updated directly from the github repo. The app includes user registration and authentication and allows for games to be started, saved on the server and resumed at a later date. All game history can be reviewed from the dashboard.
