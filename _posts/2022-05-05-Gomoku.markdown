description: In 2022 I created Gomoku, a full stack  web app of the popular game, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS). Using Typescript, I implimented a custom REST API to allow communication between the React frontend and Express backend. The site is hosted inside a docker container on Heroku. With continuous deployment, the game is automatically updated by committing to the live branch on github. The app includes user registration & authentication and allows for a user to start new games, save their game on the server and resumed any saved game at a later date. All of a user's game history can be reviewed from their dashboard.
